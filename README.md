Programming module project:

The AQUA platform is an air pollution data analytics solution. AQUA users are policy-makers and public servants responsible for monitoring 
the pollution levels in different areas of the country.

Three available modules:
1) Pollution Reporting (PR)
- Provides relevant information regarding the pollution levels at the different monitoring stations. 
- From the PR module users can generate an array of statistics at different aggregation levels, namely by hour, day, month, week and day of the week.

2) Mobility Intelligence (MI)
- Responsible for the analyses of the road infrastructure around one of the three monitoring stations (so-called 'walkability')

3) Real-time Monitoring (RM)
- Provides real-time statistics for different monitoring stations and pollutants (based on data obtained from the
London Air API (https://www.londonair.org.uk/Londonair/API/)).
